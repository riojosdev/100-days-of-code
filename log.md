# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JavaScript Objects, did a css illustration, started reading git documentation.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with relearning JavaScript. I only wanted to revisit parts that which I am not actually remembered. So JS objects, as it is one of the important part. I wanted to do DOM manipulation, so I came to a block which led me here. 
I also tried a illustration with CSS. It was of a koala. I tried it by referencing the [tutorial on medium of CSS images.](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2) I'll create more images of CSS. 
Also started to read Git documentation. I really want a Version Control System since of all the advantages and uses. It's really a gem!

### Day 1: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made my first codepen pen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding today. But created a codepen pen. And published it. It was a really simple design. It's too simple if you ask me. But overall its good. 
Spent the rest of the day planning about blogging. Got a few ideas which I would love to write about. Probably I might publish it tomorrow. Maybe... Only got points of what to write. I need to make it as a readable content. We'll see.
