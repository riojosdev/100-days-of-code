# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JavaScript Objects, did a css illustration, started reading git documentation.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with relearning JavaScript. I only wanted to revisit parts that which I am not actually remembered. So JS objects, as it is one of the important part. I wanted to do DOM manipulation, so I came to a block which led me here. 
I also tried a illustration with CSS. It was of a koala. I tried it by referencing the [tutorial on medium of CSS images.](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2) I'll create more images of CSS. 
Also started to read Git documentation. I really want a Version Control System since of all the advantages and uses. It's really a gem!

### Day 1: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made my first codepen pen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding today. But created a codepen pen. And published it. It was a really simple design. It's too simple if you ask me. But overall its good. 
Spent the rest of the day planning about blogging. Got a few ideas which I would love to write about. Probably I might publish it tomorrow. Maybe... Only got points of what to write. I need to make it as a readable content. We'll see.

### Day 6: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a new CSS illustration and posted a new article for coders.

**Thoughts:** I published the blog I started creating yesterday on the DEV website.
I also created a new codepen CSS illustration. It was a flat design illustration of planet Earth. 
Later I decided to focus more on Javascript. But I got stuck at the first line of code I wrote. I fixed the error. But I feel I need to learn more.
Figured I would do the same thing I did to improve my CSS skill. So, I tried making myself a button function. But felt like it wasn't a challenging enough.
Visited some websites, blogs.. I then revisited wikiversity. Remembered they had a web design page. It had JavaScript challenges. 
Most of the challenges proved that I was thinking the same thing. Really appreciate the one who created it. I don't have to think a lot on how to deal with creating a small project to learn.
Really felt tired. So, I'm going to take some time off today. And restart freshly tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** So I started making a game. It is really hard to come up with one of your idea. It was easier to be analytical.
But the game creation made me realize the creativity is much harder. I had to think a lot and I got an idea to try out. And I have started making one. I had some troubles but I fixed it with some help from Stackoverflow. Now I need to add more functionalities. Also I need to add animations. Levels, Power ups.

**Today's Progress**: Adding more functionalities to the game

**Thoughts:** My internet was down. So I had to code with what I knew.

### Day 25: May 26, 2020

I made a CSS illustration of a Raised fist. The current issue on black lives matter motivated me to create it.
Also I realized I need to add more things to the game for making people stay.
I also realized I was having a lot of free time so I started learning React. I might also learn Angular.js when I'm away from desktop. As I have the perfect place to learn Angular.js and I can do that on my phone.

### Day 30: Jun 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Node.js

**Thoughts:** I know I started learning React. But I found out It would much more beneficial to learn node.
I have some project ideas that I need to work on. And Node.js is an important part of it. I hope I can do it quickly.
But I should also remember that it isn't the time I'm spending but the journey I'm having.

### Day 31: Jun 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played with CSS, learned about color theory

**Thoughts:** Today I was making a CSS drawing. When I started coloring, I stumbled across a road block. It was to find the color between two colors. I hd a really hard time in find the perfect color. Researched about different color pickers. I felt I need to create another one myself to find the appropriate colors.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 32: Jun 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning Node.js

**Thoughts:** Today I tried making another CSS drawing but, I couldn't get it responsive. As I used only percentages for all the child elements. Every time I resized the window. The elements change position making the shape meaningless. I need more knowledge on CSS still. I guess I am still not a pro.
Later today I went back in learning Node.js

### Day 33: Jun 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Found the Glitch Community

### Day 35: Jun 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Bot making using Node.js

**Thoughts:** Since Node.js was kinda easy to pick up on. I am starting to experiment with Bots.
I figured Discord would be the best place to start.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 36: Jun 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about how to send and reply messages on discord using a Node.js Bot

**Thoughts:** So the moment I switched my bots status to online was a precious moment. And it was where it all started.
I mean this is the future. The best place for **hobbyist!**
**I have also learned a sad truth that if/else statements is a headache to work on!** It said that it becomes complicated. 
So a workaround was done. It was another beautiful peice of code.

### Day 37: Jun 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating dynamic commands for Discord using Node.js

**Thoughts:** Okay this was the best part of the code. I really loved how the code was structured to make it easy for building commands. It was like a small framework. But not a framework per se. I mean this is my first time on really deep into an API. So I guess, it felt like I was working on a framework. 
Dynamic Commands made it easier to code and edit even in the future. I was getting little bit stressed because of the complicated way the statements were written. Dynamic Commands is a life-saver :P

### Day 38: Jun 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS illustration on BlackLivesMatter

### Day 43: Jun 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out NASA's API of InSight Mars Lander (**APIs**) on the Elysium Planitia

**Thoughts:** I think I learned a lot about API calls and JSON. NASA's Weather API was my first experiment. Tried to graph the wind! I got the data from API and got the JSON. But when I tried to convert it to a graph data. I found that some of the data are missing! It's omitted from the API. And without the data it can work. But I feel like I'm using broken pot to fill water, lol. I even **reported the bug to NASA**, LOL XD! I would like to contribute! But I guess I'm really a FrontEnd Developer. One day software engineers!!! ONE DAY!
