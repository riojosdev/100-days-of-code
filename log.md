# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JavaScript Objects, did a css illustration, started reading git documentation.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with relearning JavaScript. I only wanted to revisit parts that which I am not actually remembered. So JS objects, as it is one of the important part. I wanted to do DOM manipulation, so I came to a block which led me here. 
I also tried a illustration with CSS. It was of a koala. I tried it by referencing the [tutorial on medium of CSS images.](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2) I'll create more images of CSS. 
Also started to read Git documentation. I really want a Version Control System since of all the advantages and uses. It's really a gem!

### Day 1: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made my first codepen pen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding today. But created a codepen pen. And published it. It was a really simple design. It's too simple if you ask me. But overall its good. 
Spent the rest of the day planning about blogging. Got a few ideas which I would love to write about. Probably I might publish it tomorrow. Maybe... Only got points of what to write. I need to make it as a readable content. We'll see.

### Day 6: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a new CSS illustration and posted a new article for coders.

**Thoughts:** I published the blog I started creating yesterday on the DEV website.
I also created a new codepen CSS illustration. It was a flat design illustration of planet Earth. 
Later I decided to focus more on Javascript. But I got stuck at the first line of code I wrote. I fixed the error. But I feel I need to learn more.
Figured I would do the same thing I did to improve my CSS skill. So, I tried making myself a button function. But felt like it wasn't a challenging enough.
Visited some websites, blogs.. I then revisited wikiversity. Remembered they had a web design page. It had JavaScript challenges. 
Most of the challenges proved that I was thinking the same thing. Really appreciate the one who created it. I don't have to think a lot on how to deal with creating a small project to learn.
Really felt tired. So, I'm going to take some time off today. And restart freshly tomorrow.

### Day 21: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a JS Game savable with Cookies

**Thoughts:** Wanted to add a progress saving ability to the game. Figured using cookies was the best option right now.
I spent a little too much time in making it work. I'm not sure if what I tried first was wrong. 
But I found out cookies don't work locally on Chrome Browser. But Firefox and internet explorer supports local cookies.

**Today's Progress**: Adding more functionalities to the game

**Thoughts:** My internet was down. So I had to code with what I knew.
Made a power up for the game. But I came to an error, which I had no clue on how to solve. It's to strictly mark a variable as number.

### Day 25: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Adding more functionalities to the game

**Thoughts:** Added a power up to the game. I'm coding really slow. I'm not experimenting enough. I do very little each day.
I need to step it up. Today I added a ability which you can buy with your earnings and it gets called at regular intervals. Learned a lot about `setIntervals()`.

### Day 28: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made the game responsive and also made a css illustration and started learning react.

**Thoughts:** Today I made the game responsive. I didn't use media queries. Instead I used viewport dimensions. It now works perfectly on mobile and on desktop. 
I made a CSS illustration of a Raised fist. The current issue on black lives matter motivated me to create it.
Also I realized I need to add more things to the game for making people stay.
I also realized I was having a lot of free time so I started learning React. I might also learn Angular.js when I'm away from desktop. As I have the perfect place to learn Angular.js and I can do that on my phone.

### Day 30: Jun 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Node.js

**Thoughts:** I know I started learning React. But I found out It would much more beneficial to learn node.
I have some project ideas that I need to work on. And Node.js is an important part of it. I hope I can do it quickly.
But I should also remember that it isn't the time I'm spending but the journey I'm having.

### Day 31: Jun 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played with CSS, learned about color theory

**Thoughts:** Today I was making a CSS drawing. When I started coloring, I stumbled across a road block. It was to find the color between two colors. I hd a really hard time in find the perfect color. Researched about different color pickers. I felt I need to create another one myself to find the appropriate colors.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 32: Jun 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning Node.js

**Thoughts:** Today I tried making another CSS drawing but, I couldn't get it responsive. As I used only percentages for all the child elements. Every time I resized the window. The elements change position making the shape meaningless. I need more knowledge on CSS still. I guess I am still not a pro.
Later today I went back in learning Node.js

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 33: Jun 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Found the Glitch Community

### Day 35: Jun 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Bot making using Node.js

**Thoughts:** Since Node.js was kinda easy to pick up on. I am starting to experiment with Bots.
I figured Discord would be the best place to start.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 36: Jun 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about how to send and reply messages on discord using a Node.js Bot

**Thoughts:** So the moment I switched my bots status to online was a precious moment. And it was where it all started.
I mean this is the future. The best place for **hobbyist!**
**I have also learned a sad truth that if/else statements is a headache to work on!** It said that it becomes complicated. 
So a workaround was done. It was another beautiful peice of code.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 37: Jun 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating dynamic commands for Discord using Node.js

**Thoughts:** Okay this was the best part of the code. I really loved how the code was structured to make it easy for building commands. It was like a small framework. But not a framework per se. I mean this is my first time on really deep into an API. So I guess, it felt like I was working on a framework. 
Dynamic Commands made it easier to code and edit even in the future. I was getting little bit stressed because of the complicated way the statements were written. Dynamic Commands is a life-saver :P

### Day 38: Jun 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS illustration on BlackLivesMatter

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding for the past few days. My motivation and inspiration have been fighting a lot. I hope the BLM movement finds peace!

### Day 41: Jun 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning through "The Coding Train" Channel on YouTube 

**Thoughts:** So today I learned about fetch APIs in JavaScript. Learned it via "The Coding Train" Channel on YouTube. Awesome tutorials! I started watching "Working with APIs and Data in JavaScript" Playlist by the same channel. I started with this because, I wanted to learn more about APIs.

### Day 43: Jun 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out NASA's API of InSight Mars Lander (**APIs**) on the Elysium Planitia

**Thoughts:** I think I learned a lot about API calls and JSON. NASA's Weather API was my first experiment. Tried to graph the wind! I got the data from API and got the JSON. But when I tried to convert it to a graph data. I found that some of the data are missing! It's omitted from the API. And without the data it can work. But I feel like I'm using broken pot to fill water, lol. I even **reported the bug to NASA**, LOL XD! I would like to contribute! But I guess I'm really a FrontEnd Developer. One day software engineers!!! ONE DAY!

### Day 44: Jun 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried out ObservableHQ 

**Thoughts:** I have visited ObservableHQ before while I was learning D3.js 
Now I visited it again when I was trying to create a graph for the NASA's InSight Mars Lander data. It is really a learning curve. 
A bit different than normal JavaScript.

### Day 45: Jun 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Attending OpenJSWorld Conference

**Thoughts:** So this is my first time attending a conference. And this one was online and free, because of the pandemic. I came to grab a lot of info. And I did. I actually bettered my workflow. My main tool would be glitch(I'm confirming it for the last time). Also I would probably jump to Data Science. Got my Linkedin connections perfected.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 46: Jun 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Attending OpenJSWorld Conference

**Thoughts:** Day 2 of the OpenJS Foundation Conference. A lot of useful and valuable information was passed.

### Day 47: Jun 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning to use the facebook platform for instant games, chat bots, etc

**Thoughts:** Started the day by trying to get into make my disliker game to run as an instant game on messenger. Then went on learning messenger platform webhooks. Figured express framework was used, so I went through the basics. Started testing the guide. Learned about curl command. It is a cool command. Then learned about the heroku platform. Learned about deploying apps on to it. Tommorrow, I'm going to try testing with facebook's api key.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 48: Jun 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned to create a facebook messenger bot

**Thoughts:** So, I think now I'm able to create bots on the messenger platform. There are a lot of template to send messages. Gotta catch them all! :P

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 49: Jul 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the Facebook's Instant Games platform

**Thoughts:** As I'm trying to port my already built game to Facebook, it's a bit hard! Previously using cookies to save and store data. Now I have to change that. Also I haven't used any image assets just a CSS illustration. So the loading screen should just jump to 100% when clicked instantly. But it's a bit hard just because I haven't seen the code of a working game as an example. I will try searching one. Or I might try to experiment DIY style!

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 50: Jul 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the Facebook's Instant Games platform - DIY style

**Thoughts:** So, I have been learning the platform by copying and remixing one line of code at a time. It's actually going well, since I've decided to rebuild my minimalistic game on the Instant Games platform. The main thing I am a bit concerned was the config.json file. But it was easy. 

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 51: Jul 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning the Facebook's Instant Games platform - DIY style

**Thoughts:** I have ported all the code to work on Facebook Instant Games Platform. But now I'm struggling to debug all the bugs that showed up after removing all the cookies support. The main thing I'm having trouble with is the placement of diffrent functions of code in the facebook's games platform.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 52: Jul 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed porting my game on facebook! Now for facebook's cool features!

**Thoughts:** Making the setInterval function was the hardest part in porting the game. It needs to invoked at a specific time, moreover the variable needs to be declared so it's given a pointer. Since I want to use the clearInterval to delete the interval data in the pointer. But after debugging I have solved it to work perfectly without any errors. I think it's perfect. 
Now I have to build a game bot, sharing thing, leaderboard, multiplayer ability. I think a one minute match making can ve added. It would be COOL!

### Day 53: Jul 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning to build a Facebook Game Bot for my Instant Game

**Thoughts:** Ever since I finished making my game work on Facebook Instant Games I came upon a new stepping stone that is to provide more engagement to my game by adding some of Facebook provided features. Game Bot is the way. And I have learned enough to make it work. But I can't decide how to interact well. I'm actually a perfectionist. And Bot building have always set me back. BOTS!!!!

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 54: Jul 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a Game Bot for my Instant Game for Facebook

**Thoughts:** So I just made a Game Bot, I only added a small change to it, but before that it was pretty confusing. But when I tried to just code with whatever I have, it actually worked. But I am not that impressed on the way my bot communicates. Still It will be better!

### Day 55: Jul 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started to make another CSS illustration

**Thoughts:** I have been missing out of the challenge for a few days. I was actually exploring many things. And I didn't have the time to code. I have discovered Github tags, particularly the awesome-list. I have starred many repositories, I believe I have found more than 50 repositories which I am interested in very much. A lot of useful information was available. The insights I have gathered is all thanks to Github. 
Also my game which I was making on Facebook Gaming platform as an Instant game, had to pause for a bit. Because I found out that I need a business profile for publishing my game. I need some legit documents for the verification process. I would do it. But I have to have some basic prerequistes for a business. And currently I don't have them.
So, after a lot of exploration, I decide to get back into coding, so I figured to do a bit of CSS illustration. Simple!

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 56: Jul 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still building the CSS illustration

**Thoughts:** I have been building the illustration. But I am not constently working on without a break. But still I believe I'm taking too much breaks. I'm just impressed by what I can do. So I have been adding a little more realistic updates to my CSS ilustration. So far it's going great.

**Link(s) to work**: None

### Day 57: Jul 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS illustration!

**Thoughts:** So today I finished the CSS illustration which I have been working on. I had to add a lot of elements to make it appear a bit realistic. But overall a great way to learn a lot about CSS. I'm great at it now.

### Day 58: Jul 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning ObservableHQ and also trying out Open Web Analytics

**Thoughts:** I have always wanted to try out ObservableHQ notebook. It is an incredible platform to do interactive Data Visulaization. I could feel the potential. But there is bit of learning curve to it. It is JavaScript but not the way We learned to do javascript. I have found their official tutorials and started learning that.
Later I felt I needed to update some of my strategies. And I came upon Open Web Analytics framework a great alternative to Google Analytics. So I figured to do that too on the side. But it kinda requires a server side dashboard, so now I think I have to build a dashboard on Heroku with a touch of PHP and MySQL. Now I'm getting back on PHP after a long time. I feel kinda unmotivated to do PHP. I'm actually excited to do JavaScript!

**Today's Progress**: Building a Blog

**Thoughts:** So today I started to build a website. This time I'm kind of focusing on building a blog. I wanted to do it really fast. But making things responsive is my weakness, I just figured out! I prepared the content like really fast. Made up the structure also. But when I tried adding interactiveness, the things are really ugly. They are not that perfect. Making things responsive is really hard. And moreover, I realized making responsive typography is the most hardest. So I have to stop this blog building for a while and start doing some typography experiments!

### Day 61: Jul 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing building the blog also deployed as beta version

**Thoughts:** Blog building was kind of fun. I released it on vercel (previously zeit). I'm trying to focus on the structure so that editing it int the future becomes easy task for me. When I deployed it I realized there are a few changes I have to make. It is not broken but I need it to be more perfect for the eyes. Really spark  a mind. Also the real blog part I need to find a way to stylize the article. Right now it looks like my high school notebook.

### Day 62: Jul 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a Blog post on Humane Tech

**Thoughts:** I wrote an article on Dev.to on Humane Tech. I did my first post on Humane Tech. And I did this because I decided to choose this as my niche. Long way to go!

### Day 63: Jul 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about MongoDB

**Thoughts:** While I was making a new app. I came across a problem. Actually I had to use another technology. It was the database! So I decided to learn MongoDB. I do know how to add basic database functionalities using MySQL. But I wanted to learn another. I didn't want to use MySQL. It was widely used, and I have no knowledge on the NoSQL technologies. So I started learning MongoDB. Just to find how NoSQL is different than MySQL.

**Today's Progress**: Learning MongoDB

**Thoughts:** My second day in learning MongoDB. I have to say w3schools is the best place to learn. I can't seem to motivate myself on other platforms. I would really love to appreciate the ones who created the tutorial. It is just the basics! And the only one needed to get started really quickly. Just a 3/4 functions left to learn. So, I'm going back to it. I want to build something today! Whoo

### Day 65: Aug 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned MongoDB started building a server with it. HTTP protocol revisited!

**Thoughts:** I learned how to do CRUD operation with MongoDB! Now I had to build a server. When I tried there was something I always skipped. The HTTP protocol. I didn't even know it perfectly. This time HTTP protocol was the only thing that stands in my way. Blocking a lot of the skill and potential. 

I don't know why but HTTP protocol was the only thing I didn't even care to think about. I ask with my heart broken that please let me use the HTTP protocol. And be with me until I can HTTP you so good. I promise my HTTP will be the only one you would ever need.

Okay back to HTTP protocol learning. Let's see what knowledge I can consume.

**Today's Progress**: Learning to create an entire simple website using ExpressJS

**Thoughts:** After I explored the HTTP protocol world <3 <3 <3 . I tried to build the website using NodeJS. But in that "http" module I didn't find a way which I understood on how to handle the incoming POST requests. Which is supposed to be the Database CRUD operations. It was too complicated. So I decided to use ExpressJS and come back later to do the same thing alone on just NodeJS.
So I started Learning on how to create a perfect website using ExpressJS. And I'm learning on the MDN!

### Day 67: Aug 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned just the basic fundamentals to start using ExpressJS

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot of how NodeJS creates a server and how the client and server communicates with each other. But to implement it in my web-app is more complicated, it is like I'm reinventing the wheel. So ExpressJS is the most easy way to move forward with. And I can say it is a lot easier than just Node.
Anyway I learned how to make a simple Web server using ExpressJS and also learned different properties which I can use. Now all I need is to do some examples. So I can know how to build an entire Web server.
Also DEFCON is starting from tomorrow. So I probably would be around that. Let's see what I can pick up!

### Day 69: Aug 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning ExpressJS (Database connecting, Skeleton Website, Routers)

**Thoughts:** ExpressJS is really an incredible library. It really helps in speeding up the workflow. I am following up the MDN tutorials on making a local library website. I was planning to learn MongoDB. But I have learned a lot more than MongoDB. Like Mongoose, ExpressJS application generator...

### Day 70: Aug 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning ExpressJS (Displaying data using views)

**Thoughts:** Looks like I'm working on a MVC structured app. And since this is my first I feel like Views are the hardest. It also might be because I just started on Views. Also I am using the Pug view template engine. So it means I'm kind of starting over. Anyway, I do love a challenge. And I'm learning more tools at the same time. 

Can't touch this!

### Day 71: Aug 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning ExpressJS (Displaying data using views)

**Thoughts:** Okay the views are not that hard. It was pretty simple. I just need to learn the file structure better.

### Day 72: Aug 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning ExpressJS (Forms)

**Thoughts:** I started on form, and displaying form is not that a hard task. But the validation and sanitation. I always was stuck at the validation part. I kind of hate it. But I think it's because I think it is widely used by REGEX. And everyone hates REGEX. But this could be my challenge. I could beat most Noobs!

### Day 73: Aug 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learning ExpressJS (Delete, Create Forms)

**Thoughts:** I learned about displaying the create and delete form. And how to make it do those create and delete operations. It's a bit hard task. A little complicated. I think it's because of the spreaded out structure. By the express application generator. I am a bit confused. I guess I need to get comfortable to this specific format. And it's okay to lock myself to this data format. As this is a language I hope to keep using for a long time. MERN stack!!!

### Day 74: Aug 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished MDN ExpressJS Mongoose Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Building a NoSQL database using Mongoose with ExpressJS. I really liked that they did show an entire working example. Almost close to real world app. I learned a lot on how to make a database connection. Setting routes in ExpressJS. Creating an ExpressJS skeleton with Express Application generator. Creating views on Express using the Pug Template engine. CRUD operations on database and using a MVC to do the specific CRUD operations. Using Express middleware like Validator to validate and sanitize the data. Also using Moment middleware to format the date and time. Building forms to give client the ability to do CRUD operations. 
Overall, I had a great time learning a lot. I took a giant leap with the help of MDN Web Docs. Thank You MDN <3

### Day 76: Aug 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Emacs

**Thoughts:** I stumbledupon Emacs and I am really impressed by all the cool features it has. Moreover it is GPL licensed. Free software where I can copy, modify and even learn all the inner workings. Also there was an ability to add IRC chat. Which makes it even more intresting. And it's everything in one window. I don't even need to switch windows. My workflow gets really smooth and I will save a lot of time. There is also an RSS feed. Also a browser. Not sure how it works. Images won't appear I guess, not sure. I even imagined myself writing a blog on it. Which I can save it with git and make it available anywhere. I wish I known this a long time before. Also I installed spacemacs which is a modern Emacs. But I need to get comfortable with Emacs before I could go to Spacemacs.
