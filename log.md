# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JavaScript Objects, did a css illustration, started reading git documentation.

**Thoughts:** I started the day with relearning JavaScript. I only wanted to revisit parts that which I am not actually remembered. So JS objects, as it is one of the important part. I wanted to do DOM manipulation, so I came to a block which led me here. 
I also tried a illustration with CSS. It was of a koala. I tried it by referencing the [tutorial on medium of CSS images.](https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2) I'll create more images of CSS. 
Also started to read Git documentation. I really want a Version Control System since of all the advantages and uses. It's really a gem!

### Day 1: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made my first codepen pen.

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much coding today. But created a codepen pen. And published it. It was a really simple design. It's too simple if you ask me. But overall its good. 
Spent the rest of the day planning about blogging. Got a few ideas which I would love to write about. Probably I might publish it tomorrow. Maybe... Only got points of what to write. I need to make it as a readable content. We'll see.

### Day 6: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a new CSS illustration and posted a new article for coders.

**Thoughts:** I published the blog I started creating yesterday on the DEV website.
I also created a new codepen CSS illustration. It was a flat design illustration of planet Earth. 
Later I decided to focus more on Javascript. But I got stuck at the first line of code I wrote. I fixed the error. But I feel I need to learn more.
Figured I would do the same thing I did to improve my CSS skill. So, I tried making myself a button function. But felt like it wasn't a challenging enough.
Visited some websites, blogs.. I then revisited wikiversity. Remembered they had a web design page. It had JavaScript challenges. 
Most of the challenges proved that I was thinking the same thing. Really appreciate the one who created it. I don't have to think a lot on how to deal with creating a small project to learn.
Really felt tired. So, I'm going to take some time off today. And restart freshly tomorrow.
