## 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R2D1 : June 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started learning A-frame. Spent the day discovering various features and following the A-frame, WebVR, WebXR community. Also watched a quick demonstration of the A-Frame on Youtube.

**Thoughts:** Aframe works using the newest version of the WebVR API called WebXR. WebVR is depreciated. The community projects really inspires creativity. It is marked as "fun". I need to get more details on how it affect us.
